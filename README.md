# nixos-configs
My personal NixOS system configs

The nixos/ directory is shared between all configs, it contains defaults and reusable snippets to accelerate the creation of system configs

## Why NixOS?

* Nix, which is both a successful and feature-rich package manager, as well as a powerful, declarative, and easy-to-read programming language
* Stable, yet bleeding edge at the same time
* Minimal, containing only what you put on it
* Hardware agnostic reproducibility, only put effort into setting something up ONCE!
* Immutability, changes only when you explicitly build it
* Package isolation, free from file conflicts
* Snapshot management and automated snapshots, select any build during boot
